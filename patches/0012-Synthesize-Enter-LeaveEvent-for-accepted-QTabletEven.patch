Subject: [PATCH 1/4] Synthesize Enter/LeaveEvent for accepted QTabletEvent

When the tablet event is accepted, then Qt doesn't synthesize a mouse
event, it means that QApplicationPrivate::sendMouseEvent() will not be
called, and, therefore, enter/leave events will not be dispatched.

The patch looks a bit hackish. Ideally, the synthesize should happen
in QGuiApplicationPrivate::processTabletEvent(), which takes the decision
about synthesizing mouse events. But there is not enough information
on this level: neither qt_last_mouse_receiver nor the receiver widget
are known at this stage.
